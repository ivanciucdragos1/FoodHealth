# ðŸ“‹ iOS Developer Test - What You Built

**Name**: _[Dragos Ivanciuc]_  
**Time Spent**: _[~12h]_  
**Date**: _[27.06.2025]_

## âœ… What You Implemented

### Core Features
- [âœ…] **Register & Login** - Basic auth flow working
- [âœ…] **Photo Selection** - Photo library or camera
- [âœ…] **API Integration** - Send image, get nutrition data  
- [âœ…] **Display Results** - Show calories and nutrition info

### Code Quality
- [âœ…] **MVVM Pattern** - ViewModels and clean structure
- [âœ…] **Working App** - Full user journey from auth to results

## ðŸ’­ Brief Summary

**Tell us about your approach and any challenges:**
```
[I used MVVM for clear separation of concerns and async/await for smooth networking. 
 Combining Views and ViewModels within the same folder kept things simple and easy to manage. 
 The biggest challenge was handling image selection from the photo library 
 especially making sure the picker reset correctly and worked on real devices.

For production, Iâ€™d improve error handling, add loading states with better UX feedback, 
and support multiple image uploads. Iâ€™d also implement user profiles, separate meals by day, 
and track daily nutrition goals per individual. Monetization could come through ads or subscriptions. 
If scaled further, Iâ€™d add charts for trends, reminders to log meals, barcode scanning, 
AI-based meal suggestions, and cloud sync across devices.]
